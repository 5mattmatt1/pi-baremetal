Raspberry Pi bare metal experiments
===================================

Sets up GPIO16 (OK LED, active low) as an output, and GPIO 14 as an
input, with a pull-up resistor. Loops round copying the state of GPIO14
to GPIO16. Bringing GPIO14 low will light up the OK LED; this can be done
by shorting it to the GND - connect pins 6 and 8 on the I/O connector.

This isn't really a good idea, for all sorts of reasons (for example,
if GPIO 14 is accidentally set to output high), but it suffices for a
quick test.
